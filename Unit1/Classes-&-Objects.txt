Intro:

* Class is created using keyword class.
* It holds data and functions.
* Class links the code and data.
* The data and functions of the class are called as members of the class.


* Objects are variables
* They are the copy of a Class
* Each of them has Properties and Behavior.
* Properties are defined through data elements.
* Behavior is defined through member function called methods.


Syntax:

class class-name{

public/private/protected:
Data members
Member Functions

};

Note:
* class-name in coding style starts with Capital letter.
* Declaration of the member functions takes place first (using access specifier) and then the data members (using access specifier).




-> Public Specifier:

* The public Specifier allows the data to be accessed outside the class.
* A public member can be used anywhere in the program.


-> Protected Specifier:

* Protected members cannot be accessed from outside the class.
* They can be accessed by a derived class.


-> Scope Resolution Operator

* It is used to access hidden data
* To access the variable or function with the same name we use :: operator
* Suppose the local variable and the global variable have the same name.
* The local variable gets the priority.
* We can access the global variable using :: operator
