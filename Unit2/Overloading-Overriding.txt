Function Overloading:
* Function Overloading means two or more function can have same name.
* The number of arguments and the data-type of the arguments will be different.
* When the function is called it is selected based on the argument list.


Function Overriding:

* Redefining a base class function in the derived class.
* The derived class function overrides the base class function.
* But the arguments passed are same.
* return type is also same



* Overloading can occur without inheritance.
* Overriding occurs when one class is inherited from another
* In overloading the arguments and the return-type must differ
* In overriding the arguments and the return type must be same.
* In overloading the fucntion name is same but it behaves differently depending on the arguments passed to them.
* In overriding the function name is same , derived class function can perform different operations from the base class.
