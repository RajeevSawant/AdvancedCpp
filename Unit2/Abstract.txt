* Abstract class is always a base class.
* It contains atleast one pure virtual function.
* We cannot create an instance of abstract class.



* A pure virtual function is a func with no body.
* it is not defined in a base class.
* It is declared as
    virtual void virtualfunname() = 0;

* A derived class must override the func , other wise compiler will give an error.
* It is upto a derived class to implement the function
*
